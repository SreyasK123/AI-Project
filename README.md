# AI Project

## Overview
This is our course project for CS2203: Artificial Intelligence at IIT Patna under Dr. Chandranath Adak.

The task was to create an AI agent using introductory models taught in class.

The following project uses a genetic algorithm and usually creates a perfect AI agent in less than 5 generations of the algorithm, which is 50% faster than older models that needed 10â€“20 generations.

This project uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to evolve a neural network capable of playing Flappy Bird. The AI improves over generations by adapting its structure and weights to navigate obstacles and achieve higher scores.

## Features
- Uses genetic algorithm to train the model.
- Has a user-friendly GUI.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SreyasK123/AI-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python flappy_ai.py
   ```
